## Overview


With over 130+ clubs and associations at REVA University, webinars, workshops and other activities being conducted nearly every day, it can be cumbersome to organize, promote and conduct these events smoothly. That’s why we’ve created Ibento. An all inclusive app for efficient and seamless sharing of organizational resources, to help you reach your audience without being concerned about an overlapping schedule. 


## How It Works

Ibento (Japanese for ‘Event’), is a university-based app. The homepage includes a weekly calendar for students to view and keep track of registered events and events that are of interest to them. Organizers can additionally conduct a seminar for selected students and send out customized notifications individually. Integration with a strong database takes care of all the scheduling. After registration, students will also receive emails on successful registration to remind them at three intervals. Keeping track of attendance is also incorporated within the app.
